# Divided-Difference-Table
In mathematics, divided differences is an algorithm, historically used for computing tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions.[citation needed] Charles Babbage's difference engine, an early mechanical calculator, was designed to use this algorithm in its operation. Divided differences is a recursive division process.
